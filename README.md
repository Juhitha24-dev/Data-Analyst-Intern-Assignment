# **<u>Report: Analysis of User Behavior, Cooking Preferences, and Order Trends</u>**

## **<u>Introduction</u>** 

The purpose of this report is to analyze the datasets provided, which include information on user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends. The datasets used for this analysis are 'UserDetails.csv', 'CookingSessions.csv', and 'OrderDetails.csv'. These datasets contain information on user demographics, cooking sessions, and orders placed. The report will analyze the relationship between cooking sessions and user orders, identify popular dishes, explore demographic factors that influence user behavior, and provide key insights and business recommendations. 

## **<u>Data Cleaning and Merging</u>** 

The datasets were first cleaned by removing any null values. The columns Registration Date, Session Start, Session End, and Order Date were converted to datetime types for further analysis. The datasets were then merged on Session ID and User ID to create a single dataset for analysis. The resulting dataset contains information on all aspects of user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends. 

## **<u>Analysis of the Relationship Between Cooking Sessions and User Orders</u>** 

The merged dataset was analyzed to understand the relationship between cooking sessions and user orders. It was found that users who had longer cooking sessions tended to place more orders. Additionally, users who rated their cooking sessions highly were more likely to place an order. 

## **<u>Identification of Popular Dishes</u>** 

The most popular dishes were identified based on the number of times they were ordered. The top 5 most ordered dishes are 'Spaghetti', 'Grilled Chicken', 'Caesar Salad', 'Pancakes', and 'Oatmeal'. These dishes are all relatively simple to prepare and are popular across different meal types. 

## **<u>Exploration of Demographic Factors that Influence User Behavior</u>**

The dataset was also used to explore demographic factors that influence user behavior. It was found that users between the ages of 25 and 35 were the most active users of the platform. Additionally, users in New York and Chicago were the most likely to place an order. 

## **<u>Key Insights and Business Recommendations</u>** 

Based on the analysis, the following key insights and business recommendations are provided:

* Focus on promoting easy-to-prepare dishes: The most popular dishes are all easy to prepare, suggesting that users prefer meals that can be cooked quickly and easily. 
* Target users in New York and Chicago: These cities have the highest number of orders, indicating a potential for growth in these markets. 
* Develop marketing campaigns for users between 25 and 35: This age group is the most active on the platform, and targeted campaigns could increase engagement and orders. 
* Offer incentives for longer cooking sessions: Longer cooking sessions are correlated with more orders, so offering incentives for longer sessions could encourage users to cook more often. 
* Highlight highly-rated cooking sessions: Highly-rated sessions are more likely to lead to orders, so showcasing these sessions could encourage users to try new dishes and place orders. 

## **<u>Conclusion</u>** 

The analysis of the datasets provided valuable insights into user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends. By focusing on the key insights and implementing the business recommendations provided, the platform can potentially increase user engagement, orders, and overall satisfaction.
